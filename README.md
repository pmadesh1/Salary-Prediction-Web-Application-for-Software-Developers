# Salary-Prediction-Web-Application-for-Software-Developers

Description:

This is a machine learning web application that predicts the salary of software developers based on their country, years of experience, and education level, using real-world data collected from the Stack Overflow 2022 survey. The web application is built using the Streamlit library, which provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to input their data and receive a salary prediction.

The project includes data manipulation using NumPy and Pandas to create an appropriate data frame for the machine learning model. The DecisionTreeRegressor model is used to train the model, with the best value estimator obtained from GridSearchCV. The serialized model is saved using Pickle for future predictions.

This project provides an efficient and accurate way for software developers to estimate their salaries based on their qualifications and location. The open-source code and documentation can be found in this repository, along with the necessary files to run the web application.
